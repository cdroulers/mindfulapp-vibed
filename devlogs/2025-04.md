## Work Completed

### Project Setup

- Created a new Vite + React project with TypeScript
- Set up Volta for Node.js version management (Node 22.14.0 LTS, npm 11.2.0)
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Set up Mantine UI library for the component system

### Project Structure

- Implemented vertical slices architecture
- Created directory structure:
  - `src/features/` - Feature-based modules
  - `src/shared/` - Shared resources (components, hooks, utils, types, services)

### Configuration Files

- Created and configured:
  - `package.json` with all necessary dependencies
  - `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` for TypeScript
  - `vite.config.ts` for build and development settings
  - `.eslintrc.json` for linting rules
  - `.prettierrc` for code formatting
  - `.gitignore` for version control exclusions

### Core Infrastructure

- Set up PouchDB for local data storage
- Created basic service worker for offline functionality
- Implemented web app manifest for PWA support
- Added basic TypeScript types for journal entries

### Dependencies

- Installed and configured:
  - React 18.2.0
  - Mantine UI components and hooks
  - PouchDB for local storage
  - TypeScript and type definitions
  - ESLint and Prettier for code quality
  - Vite for build tooling

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Journal Entry Data Model
2. Create the Main Page with entry listing
3. Build the Add Entry Modal
4. Implement the Edit Entry Modal
5. Set up the Service Worker for offline functionality

## Notes

- Fixed an issue with @types/pouchdb-browser version compatibility
- Configured path aliases for cleaner imports
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration for Node.js modules

## Work Completed

### Build and Linting Fixes

- Resolved build errors in `App.tsx` by removing unused React import and correcting MantineProvider props.
- Fixed numerous linting errors (line endings, quote styles) across the codebase by:
  - Updating the Prettier format script in `package.json` to include `vite.config.ts` and enforce `lf` line endings.
  - Running `npm run format` to apply fixes.
- Created `.prettierignore` file to exclude `node_modules` and build output directories.

### Enhancements

- Set the application favicon and PWA manifest icon to `public/logo.png`.
- Updated the default development server port to `3333` in `vite.config.ts`.
- Made service worker registration optional during development:
  - Added `ENABLE_SW` environment variable check in `main.tsx`.
  - Added `cross-env` dependency.
  - Created `dev:sw` script in `package.json` to run with the service worker (`npm run dev:sw`).

### Dependency Management

- Updated all dependencies to their latest compatible versions (including major updates for PouchDB, ESLint-related packages, date-fns).
- Resolved security vulnerabilities by updating Vite to `6.2.5` using `npm audit fix --force`.
- Pinned exact dependency versions in `package.json` to ensure consistent builds.

### Testing Setup

- Added Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration tests:
  - Installed necessary dependencies (`jest`, `ts-jest`, `@testing-library/*`, etc.).
  - Configured Jest via `jest.config.ts` (including TypeScript support, module mapping, test environment).
  - Created `setupTests.ts` for global test setup (importing `jest-dom`).
  - Added a basic test for the `App` component (`App.test.tsx`).
  - Added `test` script to `package.json`.
- Added Playwright for end-to-end tests:
  - Installed `@playwright/test` and browser dependencies.
  - Configured Playwright via `playwright.config.ts` (including web server setup).
  - Created a basic E2E test (`tests/example.spec.ts`) to check the homepage title.
  - Added `test:e2e` script to `package.json`.

## Notes

- Verified that `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`, `npm run test`, and `npm run test:e2e` all run successfully.
- A warning about TypeScript version compatibility with `@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree` still exists but doesn't cause errors.
- React was kept at v18 due to compatibility issues with v19 and other dependencies.
- Updated the Playwright test directory from `tests` to `e2e` in `playwright.config.ts`.
