- Created directory structure:
  - `src/features/` - Feature-based modules
  - `src/shared/` - Shared resources (components, hooks, utils, types, services)

### Configuration Files

- Created and configured:
  - `package.json` with all necessary dependencies
  - `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` for TypeScript
  - `vite.config.ts` for build and development settings
  - `.eslintrc.json` for linting rules
  - `.prettierrc` for code formatting
  - `.gitignore` for version control exclusions

### Core Infrastructure

- Set up PouchDB for local data storage
- Created basic service worker for offline functionality
- Implemented web app manifest for PWA support
- Added basic TypeScript types for journal entries

### Dependencies

- Installed and configured:
  - React 18.2.0
  - Mantine UI components and hooks
  - PouchDB for local storage
  - TypeScript and type definitions
  - ESLint and Prettier for code quality
  - Vite for build tooling

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Journal Entry Data Model

3. Build the Add Entry Modal
4. Implement the Edit Entry Modal
5. Set up the Service Worker for offline functionality

## Notes
