I'd like to generate a project spec sheet with a clear todo list following the following content

# Daily journaling app

An offline first web app using service workers built with ReactJS, using PouchDB as the browser database.

## Main Page

The main page should be a list of all existing entries, with a create new entry button at the top right.
