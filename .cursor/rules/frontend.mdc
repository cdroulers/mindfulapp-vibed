# Frontend development rules

## Convention

- Avoid default exports. Always use named exports.

## Unit tests

- Make sure to add unit tests with @testing-library/react.
- Use `userEvent` for actions.
- Avoid jest mocking if possible.

## e2e tests

- Use Playwright for end-to-end tests
- Use `npm run test:e2e:agent` as the base command when running the tests.
